During this project, I was able to cover a range of topics, including building full-stack applications, working with complex MongoDB queries, schemas, and models, and creating user interfaces.

I also got cover how to implement JWT authentication and password hashing for securing the application. Also, how to implement notifications functionality for users

The techologies used was the MERN stack

MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack.

    MongoDB - document database

    Express(.js) - Node.js web framework

    React(.js) - a client-side JavaScript framework

    Node(.js) - the premier JavaScript web server

Express and Node make up the middle (application) tier. Express.js is a server-side web framework and Node.js is the famous and powerful JavaScript server platform.

React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies.

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser designed to build scalable network applications.
